This app queries the New York Times website and presents the top articles and their links to the page. It's your very own newspaper in a simplified page!

# Issues
* The biggest problem I faced was parsing the headline from the lede that is offered in the webpage. In V.2 I would like to separate each section into three different elements: A headline, a lede, and a link. 

* The notes appends to the page, but as of yet, they don't update and are not entirely connected to the headline. I would like for the notes to append directly next to the articles rather than to the bottom of the page

* For V.2 I would like to turn this app into a full MVC app.
